    "text": "My initial learning goals involve building a strong foundation in embedded systems design. With a basic understanding of digital design and microcontroller programming, I hope to deepen my knowledge and skills.\nThe first goal is to become proficient in designing and implementing combinational and sequential circuits on FPGAs. I also want to gain hands-on experience with microcontrollers to create functional embedded systems. Additionally, my goal is to develop the ability to select the suitable hardware components and to debug circuits. Beyond the technical skills, I want to improve my ability to communicate complex technical results clearly and professionally through presentations and reports."
